# README_Generator
This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input, using the Inquirer package. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.
